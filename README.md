# burger

In this web app, you can submit the kind of burger you want to eat and the app will save that information to a database for you.

Additionally, you can "Munch" your burger whenever you want which will tell the database that you have devoured it.

At this point, the database recognizes that you have devoured a burger but will not automatically reload. You will need to mannually reload for reasons unknown to this coder. Sorry about that.
